**It's been a long since I wrote a blog so I thought let's try something not everyone talks about. The Importance of Best practices and Design Principles for a Web Developer.This will be my first blog regarding backend development. Let's get Started....**

# What the Heck is MVC?
First of All, MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. A certain set of rules/principles for maintaining your Code Structure which is quite popular in Backend Development.
It suggests separating our file structure into three parts and dividing the logic of our app by its utility.

### Now let's dig deep into each one of them.

## 1. MODEL :
The Model contains the Schema of your app which can be defined by any ORM (Object Relational Mapper) or ODM (Object Document Mapper) of your choice. 
The sole purpose of a Model is to interact (query/store) to the Database from your App.

Basically storing your app data to a database with the help of Schema (the structure in which the data should be stored) generation is done by the Model Files.

```javascript
// models/goal.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// save our data in our database according to our given schema structure
const goalschema = mongoose.Schema({
  user: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    required: true,
    ref: 'User'
  },
  text1: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please Add a Text Value']
  }
}, {
  timestamps: true
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Goal', goalschema);

```

## 2. VIEW :
The user doesn't care about what your app does behind the scenes.
He only cares about the data it receives when it sends a Request to the server.

The View files are primarily your HTML, CSS and JS files but can also contain other static files like Videos, Images or any Other Text or Media files.
In Node JS Express Framework, these files go in the Public folder which gets delivered to the Browser by the Server as a response whenever a certain request is made.
The general purpose of our Views is to display the data in a user friendly manner to the Client (Web Browser).

## 3. CONTROLLER :
This is what Controls the main logic of our App.
While using NodeJS, we refer to these as **Routes** files.
It basically works as the thread between our Models and Views.
It stores and retrieves data from and to our Models and sends the data to the Views to send it back to the Client.

In an Express environment, these files work on the principles of taking a request from our Views and sending data as a response to the user.

We can also extract the logic of these files in a seperate Controller file which processes all the computation and logic of our app. This is basically a good Coding practice to keep our code concise , clean and Reusable.

```javascript
// Logic/function to run when someone hits the below route

// Description  Get Goals
// Route        GET /api/goals
// Access       Private

const getGoals = asyncHandler( async (reg,res) => {

    const goals = await Goal.find({ user : req.user.id })
    res.status(200).json(goals)
})
```

In the below snippet, our Route File runs the Controller function called *Login* and Returns data whenever our login API endpoint gets hit.

```javascript
  const express - nequire("express")
  const router - express.Router()

  const {login, dashboard} = require("../controllers/main")
  const authmiddleware = require("../middleware/auth")

// send the below response for our user to view when they hit the below Endpoint
router.route("/dashboard").get(authhiddleware, dashboard)
router.route("/login").post(login)

module.exports = router
```

*I hope this blog gave you some basic Ideas of the practical meaning of the MVC architecture and what should be your approach for structuring a new Express App. Till Next Time...*
